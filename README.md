 Learning Through Experience

CV/Resume
Updating and formatting my CV taught me how to market my strengths professionally. I improved my layout, included only relevant skills, and tailored the content for ICT positions.

Group Project
In a recent group project, I was responsible for leading a team presentation. This challenged me to manage time, guide peers, and communicate clearly. It significantly improved my teamwork and leadership skills.

Java Application
Using NetBeans to develop a reading club system enhanced my understanding of Java OOP principles, problem-solving, and debugging. This helped me better prepare for future roles in application development.

Blockchain Contract
Experimenting with the Remix Ethereum IDE was a new experience. I developed and tested simple smart contracts, gaining insight into decentralized applications and Solidity coding.

 Personal Reflection
Balancing academic work and personal responsibilities showed me the value of time management and self-discipline. I also learned to adapt to changes in project requirements and deadlines.



  My Learning Journey

This portfolio illustrates my development as a well-rounded ICT student with both soft and technical skills. Each artefact represents a significant step in my growth—whether mastering a new coding language, communicating with a team, or learning to self-reflect.

Together, these pieces connect to form a strong foundation for entering the professional world, particularly in roles related to software development, web technologies, and emerging areas like blockchain.



 Conclusion

Through work readiness training and academic projects, I have gained essential skills in communication, development, time management, and adaptability. This digital portfolio is a testament to my readiness for the workplace and my continued growth in the ICT field.
